Hello!

This repository contains a series of notebooks with statistical analysis of economic data. Each notebook contains a project itself.
Also, some files were made following courses from Alura, wich means they act not just as a analysis exercise but as a real notebook, with methods and options on dealing with specific data types.

This is all made with studying purposes, so don't take the analysis seriously.
Hope it helps with anything! Have fun :)
