Hello!

This repository contains a series of notebooks with statistical analysis of economic data. Each notebook contains a project itself.
Also, some files were made following courses from Alura, wich means they act not just as an analysis exercise but as a real notebook, with methods and options on dealing with specific data types.

This is all made for studying purposes, so don't take the analysis seriously.
Down below, i'm listing every notebook content in order.
Hope it helps with anything! Have fun :)

Notebook_1 - Statistics with python course (Alura)
Notebook_2 - Data Visualization with Seaborn course (Alura)
Notebook_3 - Time Series Analysis course (Alura)
